# Dev Commands

## Run application

```bash
# Start FastAPI app with auto-reload (dev mode)
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Alembic (database migrations)
```
# Show current applied migration (version in DB)
alembic current

# Show full migration history
alembic history

# Generate new migration based on model changes
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "message"

# Apply all pending migrations (upgrade DB to latest state)
alembic upgrade head

# Rollback last migration (use carefully)
alembic downgrade -1
```

## Docker (PostgreSQL)
```
# Start containers in background
docker compose up -d

# Stop containers
docker compose down

# Stop and REMOVE volumes (⚠️ will delete database data)
docker compose down -v
```

## PostgreSQL checks
```
-- List all tables in public schema
SELECT schemaname, tablename
FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;

-- Check current database and user
SELECT current_database(), current_user;
```

## Notes
* Keep all committed Alembic migration files in alembic/versions (this is your DB history).
* Do NOT delete migrations unless you clearly understand consequences.
* Delete temporary/debug scripts (like check_db.py) before commit.
* Store all secrets (DB credentials, SECRET_KEY) only in .env.
* Never commit .env to Git.

## Environment variables rule

* Every variable added to `.env` MUST be added to `.env.example`
* `.env.example` contains only example values (no real secrets)
* `.env` is never committed to Git
